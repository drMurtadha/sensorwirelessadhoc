## 2. Wireless Networks (20 mins)
### 2.1 Fundamentals of Wireless Networks
- **Wireless Networks** enable communication without physical connections, using radio waves for data transmission. Wireless communication is inherently flexible, making it suitable for various environments including remote and urban areas.
- **Spectrum and Frequency Bands**:
  - **Licensed vs. Unlicensed Spectrum**: Licensed bands are allocated for specific purposes (e.g., cellular networks), while unlicensed bands (e.g., Wi-Fi) are available for general use.
  - **Frequency Ranges Commonly Used**: ISM bands (e.g., 2.4 GHz), cellular bands (e.g., 700 MHz to 2.6 GHz).
- **Basics of Wireless Communication**:
  - **Modulation Techniques**: Conversion of digital data into signals suitable for wireless transmission, such as Frequency Modulation (FM), Amplitude Modulation (AM), and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), which is used in practical systems like Wi-Fi and LTE.
  - **Data Transmission**: Role of antennas in sending and receiving signals, with considerations like beamforming to improve signal strength and reduce interference.

### 2.2 Types of Wireless Networks
- **Wi-Fi (WLAN)**: Local Area Network for high-speed data in small areas like homes or offices. It uses IEEE 802.11 standards and is commonly used for internet access within limited ranges.
- **Cellular Networks**: Wide Area Network providing mobile connectivity (e.g., 4G, 5G). Cellular networks rely on a grid of base stations to offer extensive geographic coverage and support mobile user mobility.
- **LPWAN (Low-Power Wide Area Network)**: Designed for long-range communication with low power (e.g., LoRaWAN, Sigfox). Suitable for applications like smart agriculture and industrial IoT where data packets are infrequent and minimal.
- **Bluetooth**: Personal Area Network for short-distance, low-energy communication, often used for connecting peripherals such as wireless headphones, mice, and keyboards.

### 2.3 Challenges
- **Spectrum Congestion**: Limited radio frequencies and growing demand lead to congestion, especially in urban areas where multiple devices compete for the same channels.
- **Interference**: Signals overlapping in the same frequency band can disrupt communication, requiring strategies like spread spectrum and adaptive frequency hopping to minimize disruption.
- **Range Limitations**: Higher frequencies have shorter ranges and greater propagation loss, necessitating strategies such as relay nodes or mesh networking to extend coverage.

## 3. Ad-Hoc Networks (20 mins)
### 3.1 Definition and Characteristics
- **Ad-Hoc Networks** are decentralized, infrastructure-less networks where each node can act as both a host and a router, capable of dynamically joining or leaving the network as needed.
- **Dynamic Topology**: Nodes can join or leave the network freely, leading to constantly changing network structures that require adaptive routing protocols to maintain communication paths.
- **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: Direct communication between nodes without fixed infrastructure, enabling rapid deployment in scenarios where traditional infrastructure is unavailable or impractical.

### 3.2 Applications
- **Disaster Recovery**: Quick and temporary setup to restore communication during emergencies, such as after natural disasters when conventional infrastructure has been damaged.
- **Military**: Tactical operations requiring rapid, flexible, and secure network formation, often under harsh and changing environmental conditions.
- **Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs)**: Used for inter-vehicle communication to support traffic safety, vehicle platooning, and management of congestion through information sharing.

### 3.3 Comparison with Traditional Networks
- **Traditional Networks**: Typically infrastructure-based with routers, access points, and structured topology, relying on fixed routing paths and dedicated resources.
- **Ad-Hoc Networks**: No centralized infrastructure; nodes act independently and routing is more complex due to dynamic topology and the need for distributed algorithms that can handle frequent topology changes.

## 4. Sensor, Wireless, and Ad-Hoc Network Protocols (25 mins)
### 4.1 MAC Protocols
- **Medium Access Control (MAC) Protocols** are essential for managing how data is transmitted in a shared medium, ensuring collision-free communication among nodes.
- **Types of MAC Protocols**:
  - **Contention-Based Protocols**: Nodes compete for the shared medium, where collisions are avoided through mechanisms like backoff timers (e.g., CSMA/CA used in Wi-Fi).
  - **Scheduled Protocols**: Nodes are assigned slots or times to transmit, often ensuring deterministic communication (e.g., TDMA is commonly used in sensor networks).

### 4.2 Routing Protocols
- **Routing in Ad-Hoc Networks**: Efficient routing is crucial due to frequent changes in network topology. Routes need to adapt quickly to avoid broken paths caused by node mobility.
  - **Reactive Protocols**: Routes are established on demand (e.g., AODV - Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector, DSR - Dynamic Source Routing). These protocols reduce overhead by only maintaining active routes.
  - **Proactive Protocols**: Maintain routes at all times, irrespective of usage (e.g., DSDV - Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector), which can be beneficial in stable topologies but lead to high overhead in dynamic environments.
- **Routing in Sensor Networks**:
  - **Hierarchical Protocols**: LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) for efficient clustering, allowing nodes to take turns acting as cluster heads to balance energy consumption and extend network lifetime.

### 4.3 Network Layer Issues
- **Power-Aware Routing**: Protocols need to minimize energy usage due to limited power. Strategies include selecting paths that reduce transmission power or load balancing to prevent nodes from depleting energy too quickly.
- **Scalability**: The protocols must manage the addition of nodes without overwhelming control communication, which often requires localized routing decisions and clustering to reduce the control message overhead.

## 5. Challenges in Sensor, Wireless, and Ad-Hoc Networks (20 mins)
### 5.1 Resource Constraints
- **Energy**: Battery limitations require optimized protocols for power efficiency, including power-saving modes and energy-efficient communication protocols like sleep scheduling and data aggregation.
- **Memory**: Sensor nodes typically have limited storage, affecting data buffering and processing. Efficient data compression and in-network processing are often employed to address these limitations.
- **Bandwidth**: Wireless communication generally has lower bandwidth compared to wired networks, necessitating careful bandwidth management and prioritization of data traffic.

### 5.2 Mobility Management
- **Node Mobility**: In ad-hoc networks, managing dynamic network topology due to moving nodes can be challenging. Frequent link breakages require efficient rerouting mechanisms and mobility prediction.
- **Mobility Solutions**: Mobility models such as Random Waypoint and Gauss-Markov are used to predict node behavior, which aids in developing proactive routing strategies to maintain network stability.

 An example of such an attack is a wormhole attack, where an adversary records packets at one location and replays them at another, creating a false route and disrupting the network's normal operations.
- **Solutions**: Use of cryptographic techniques such as symmetric and asymmetric encryption, secure routing algorithms, and intrusion detection systems helps to counteract threats and protect data integrity.
